1. Simulation and visualization upgrades:
	a. We want to log and visualize the best performance of a network
	b. Simulator should keep track of full state of current simulation, and log it if it is the best score
	c. Upon closing the program, the user should be prompted if he wants to save the training results.
	d. If yes: the visualizer should rerun the best sim to save as .gif, and plot of the total
	   training process.
	e. In total, a saved training folder should contain: the model parameters, model nn weights and biases, video of 
	best run, and plot of training.
2. Try to create the online popular 8-directional feature representation as profile type.
